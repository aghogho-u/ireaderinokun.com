  excerpt: "Modé, the founder of the Studio of Modé, and I worked on the design together, and I developed the website on a combination of <strong>Wordpress</strong> and <strong>Shopify</strong>. The website is divided into three main parts - Modé's portfolfio (SEE), the studio and gallery space (STUDIO), and the online shop (SHOP). A key aspect of the design of the website was to make it seem as minimal as possible, despite the large amount of information avaiable. It was particularly important to have the website completely accessible on all devices due to the younger audience.",

  excerpt: 'This was a design I did as a single-day project during a short course. The brief I was given was that “Supper Club” was a “five day night-time street food meetup” who was looking for a “one page site to advertise forthcoming Supper Club events”. The requirements for the website included: A Supper Club <strong>identity</strong>, the event duration and location details, a sign up form, and social links. I designed both the Supper Club logo and the one page website.',
